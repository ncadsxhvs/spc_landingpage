# Deployment Guide - Vercel

This guide will help you deploy the Premium Flooring Landing Page to Vercel.

## 🚀 Quick Deploy

### Prerequisites
- ✅ GitHub repository: `https://github.com/ncadsxhvs/spc_landingpage.git`
- ✅ Vercel account (sign up at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com))
- ✅ Latest code pushed to main branch

---

## Method 1: Deploy via Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)

### Step 1: Import Project

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**
   - Visit [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
   - Sign in to your account

2. **Import Git Repository**
   - Click "Import Project" or "Add New..." → "Project"
   - Select "Import Git Repository"
   - Choose **GitHub** as the source
   - Find and select: `ncadsxhvs/spc_landingpage`
   - Click "Import"

### Step 2: Configure Project

Vercel will **auto-detect** these settings (no changes needed):

```
Framework Preset: Next.js
Root Directory: ./
Build Command: npm run build
Output Directory: .next
Install Command: npm install
Node.js Version: 20.x (default)
```

### Step 3: Environment Variables (Optional)

For the initial deployment, **no environment variables are required**. Your app will work perfectly without them.

**Optional variables** (can be added later):
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`: Your production URL (e.g., `https://premium-flooring.vercel.app`)

To add later:
1. Go to Project Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add variables
3. Redeploy

### Step 4: Deploy

1. Review the configuration
2. Click **"Deploy"** button
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for build to complete
4. 🎉 Your site is live!

### Step 5: Access Your Site

After deployment:
- Vercel will show your production URL (e.g., `https://premium-flooring-abc123.vercel.app`)
- Click the URL to view your live site
- Share the link!

---

## Method 2: Deploy via Vercel CLI (Alternative)

### Install Vercel CLI

```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

### Login to Vercel

```bash
vercel login
```

### Deploy

From the project root:

```bash
# Deploy to preview
vercel

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

The CLI will:
1. Link your project to Vercel
2. Upload your code
3. Build and deploy
4. Provide you with URLs

---

## 🔄 Automatic Deployments

Once connected, Vercel will automatically:

- ✅ **Deploy on git push**: Every push to `main` triggers a production deployment
- ✅ **Preview deployments**: Pull requests get unique preview URLs
- ✅ **Zero downtime**: Deployments happen without interrupting users
- ✅ **Instant rollback**: Revert to any previous deployment with one click
